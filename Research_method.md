# Data collection procedure
## Research Methodology
***

The tests will take place at the Galway campus gym in the sports hall and mainly consist of two types of tests:
#### HRV â€“ Heart Rate Variability: 
For this test, a rubber mat will be placed on the floor of the gym where the volunteer can lie down and take the test.
-   The Polar chest strap heart rate sensor will be tied to the volunteer's chest who should lie down on the mat. It's important that the tests are performed in similar conditions every time to ensure accuracy. This test usually takes 10 minutes.
-  Rodrigo and Otito, will be in the place to invigilate and support with the test.

#### Gaming test: 
For this test, two laptops will be set up with a gaming console, and game application running and ready for the user to log in and link with his/her account. The tests are divided into:
-   Visual Test
-   Audio Test
-   Fine Motor Test

The estimated time to complete all three gaming tests is 15 minutes. The user then should sign off from his/her account. At this point, all tests are finished.

### Periodicity of data collection:
Data will be collected on a weekly basis, specifically every Friday at 1:30 pm. The weekly data collection enables the study to analyse the trends and correlations over time through regression analysis.

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for the project "Biometric Data Analysis in Digital Game Scenario." The project aims to [provide a clear context for the project and set out its objectives](#chapter-1). References include works by Claude Shannon and John Von Neumann et al.

## Methodology
The project's [methodology](#chapter-2) involves a combination of software development and research methodologies. Angular, with its [component-based architecture](#advantages-of-using-angular), plays a crucial role in improving maintainability and re-usability.

### Angular Application Architecture
#### Components
Angular organizes functionalities into components, allowing seamless communication and updates without affecting the entire application. This promotes maintainability and re-usability ([source](#advantages-of-using-angular)).

#### Services
Angular services utilize TypeScript classes with injectable decorators, facilitating the injection of services into other components ([source](#advantages-of-using-angular)).

#### Angular Architecture
Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with a variation known as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). The controller manages interaction between the model and the view ([source](#angular-architecture)).

#### Advantages of using Angular
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Enables efficient communication and updates.
- **Mobile-Friendly Approach:** Incorporates techniques like lazy-loading for improved user experience.
- **Two-Way Data Binding:** Allows seamless data flow between components and views.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Enhances performance with non-sequential code execution.
- **Single-Page Applications:** Provides dynamic navigation without page reloads.
- **Code Re-usability:** Promotes the re-usability of UI components.
- **Dependency Injection:** Enhances modularity and efficiency.
- **Angular Material:** Offers a range of UI components adhering to Google's Material Design principles.
- **Angular CLI:** Facilitates project setup, saving time and reducing configuration errors ([source](#advantages-of-using-angular)).

## System Design
The overall system architecture is explained in detail, including UML diagrams, system architecture diagrams, screenshots, code snippets, and algorithms ([source](#system-design)).

## System Evaluation
The project is evaluated against the objectives set in the introduction, presenting results and discussing strengths and weaknesses ([source](#system-evaluation)).

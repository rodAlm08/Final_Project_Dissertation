## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for the project "Biometric Data Analysis in Digital Game Scenario." It also holds all commits along the project, including the project proposal submitted at an early stage and the form submitted to the Ethics approval board seeking approval for the recruitment of volunteers for our project.


## Methodology
The project's [methodology](#chapter-2) involves a combination of software development and research methodologies. Angular, with its [component-based architecture](#advantages-of-using-angular), plays a crucial role in improving maintainability and re-usability.


## Technology Review


## System Design
The overall system architecture is explained in detail, including UML diagrams, system architecture diagrams, screenshots, code snippets, and algorithms ([source](#system-design)).

## System Evaluation
The project is evaluated against the objectives set in the introduction, presenting results and discussing strengths and weaknesses ([source](#system-evaluation)).

## Conclusion

## Appendices

The Research Ethics Approval Application form, available in the file [Research Ethics Approval Application Form.docx](Research%20Ethics%20Approval%20Application%20Form.docx), provides details regarding the ethical considerations and approval sought for the research project.


- **Ethics Approval:** For a deeper understanding of the ethical considerations and approvals sought for our project, check out the [Research Ethics Approval Application Form](#research-ethics-approval-application-form) section.

\textbf{PUBG:} PUBG, short for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, is a popular online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Bluehole Studio. In PUBG, up to 100 players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The game features a shrinking safe area to force players into close encounters, promoting tactical gameplay and intense firefights. The last player or team standing wins the game. PUBG became widely popular upon its release in 2017 and is available on various platforms, including PCs, consoles, and mobile devices1.\cite{PUBG}.

Since its launch in 2017, PUBG has become incredibly popular, with more than 280M active players \cite{PUBG_users}. People of all ages and from all over the world enjoy playing this game. In PUBG, players need good hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes to compete well against others. The game offers a variety of weapons, and players can customize their controls to fit their preferences. This project builds upon the research done by university students, focusing on collecting biometric data to improve player performance in digital games~\cite{PUBG}.

\subsection*{Previous Project}
The original project, titled \textbf{"Biometric Data Collection for Performance Optimization in a Digital Game Scenario"}, aimed to find out if a player's body data could help them play a video game better. The researchers set up a practice game similar to PUBG: Battlegrounds, with the same weapons and controls in a Unity Desktop {\tt Application}. Biometric data was supplied by a {\tt Smart Watch}. The goal was to see if there was a connection between how players performed in the game and their body data.

In our third-year project, our team was given the challenge of enhancing the visualization of data from both the test games and the Polar API. To achieve this, we developed a chart API, enabling users to conveniently view all the results on a single page. The chart API was specifically created to present the data collected during the initial research in a coherent and user-friendly chart format, integrating various user data into one unified visual representation.

\section*{Project Objective}
The aim of this research project is to overcome the limitations mentioned in previous projects and complete the future development goals of both projects.
These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item {Chart API Integration}\\
Integration of developed Chart API into the test application.
\item {Offline Data Storage}\\
Provision will be made for offline temporary file storage to improve the overall reliability of the whole system
\item{PUBG API}\\
Further research on new developments in the PUBG API for better user experience. 
\end{itemize} 
        
And eventually, seek to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Can the user's current physical condition as indicated by their Biometric data, have any direct relationship with their performance in such a gaming scenario?}
\item {Can Biometric and test data help suggest the most suitable settings for different game scenarios?}
\end{itemize}
